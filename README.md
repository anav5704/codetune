## What is CodeTune ? 🎵

With <span style="color:#B4FE09">_CodeTune_</span>, coders can listen to music while they code,helping to boost their creativity, productivity and focus, The music is carefully curated to enhance the coding experience, ensuring that it does not interfere with the flow of coding.

## The Future of CodeTune 📈

I am driven to make this project open-source as I strive for its rapid growth and development. Below, you'll find the list of features I intend to add to the project (feel free to suggest any additional ones as well) :

- _Social Features_ 👤: <br />Incorporate social features, such as user profiles, the ability to follow others, and a news feed, to foster a vibrant community of coders sharing their experiences.
- _Pomodoro Technique Integration_ 🍅: <br />Offer integration with the Pomodoro Technique, allowing users to set coding intervals and breaks while enjoying suitable music during each phase.
- _Customizable Music Playlists_ 🎛️: <br />Allow users to create and save their own personalized music playlists tailored to their coding preferences and moods.
- _Productivity Insights_ ⏫: <br />Provide users with detailed productivity insights and statistics, such as coding streaks, most productive times of the day, and average coding session duration.
- _Coding Challenges_ 🗡️: <br />Introduce coding challenges within the platform, where users can participate, compete, and collaborate with others to solve coding problems while enjoying their favorite tunes.
- _Collaborative Coding Sessions_ 👥: <br />Allow users to invite others for collaborative coding sessions, with the option to listen to the same music, and code together in real-time.
- _Mobile App_ 📱: <br />Develop a mobile application, ensuring users can enjoy their coding and music experience, making it accessible across various devices.
- _Gamification and Rewards_ 🎰: <br />Introduce gamification elements, where users can earn badges, rewards, or achievements based on their coding progress and engagement on the platform.
- _AI-Powered Music Recommendations_ 🤖: <br />Use AI algorithms to analyze users' coding patterns and preferences, suggesting music that complements their coding style for a more immersive experience.
